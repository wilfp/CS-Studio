# CS Studio
Platform to learn Java using an experimental teaching methodology.

This web app is Open Source and free to use anywhere. In the future, it will be hosted on a free to use site, and allow others to test it.

This project uses an experimental methodology, which combines the static-typing and ubiquity of Java with the simplicity of a language such as Python.

We are also working on including a fully interactive in-browser IDE which will assist greatly in illustrating how code is run to a beginner user.

Keep coming back and checking it out! We're excited to see where this project takes us!
