# CS Studio
Platform to learn Java using an experimental teaching methodology.

This project combines the static-typing and ubiquity of Java with the simplicity of a language such as Python. It includes a fully interactive in-browser IDE which will assist greatly in illustrating how code is run to a beginner user.

Keep coming back and checking it out! We're excited to see where this project takes us!
