# JavaRail
A platform to learn Java using an experimental teaching methodology.

This website is Open Source and free to use anywhere. In the future, it will be hosted on a free to use site, to allow others to test it.

This project uses an experimental methodology, which combines the static-typing and ubiquity of Java with the simplicity of a language such as Python.

This project will become more fleshed out soon, for now it's fairly empty.
