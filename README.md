# CSUK Studio
Learning Java using an experimental teaching methodology. Created by experienced programmers at CSUK.

This project combines the static-typing and ubiquity of Java with the simplicity of a language such as Python. It includes a fully interactive in-browser IDE which greatly assists in illustrating how code is run to a beginner user.

Keep coming back and checking it out! We're excited to see where this project takes us!
